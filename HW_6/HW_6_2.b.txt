With Case 1, MUx and MUy are the only two things which are diffrent, 
which caused to create similler sizd grouping on topl-left and botttom_right,
which caused the boundary line to be tilted stright line.

With Case 2, MUx and MUy and RHOx and RHOy are additional diffrent components,
which caused to create unequal sized grouping on topl-left and botttom_right.
From this, we could see RHO components affects the size/consentration of pattern,
which caused the boundary line to be curved.
